The COVID-19 crisis and social distancing had a significant impact on our live. And it has affected the lives of billions of people and to a greater extent this year. ‚ÄúThe year of the pandemic‚Äù has shown that the apps are at the heart of our lives, and we rely on them more than ever before.

Contact tracing apps are used by health departments to find people who may have come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19. Apps aid in the collection of data and the tracking of people's movements, making the process faster and more useful. Some may be able to identify people who may have been exposed to the virus, allowing them to isolate themselves and monitor for symptoms.

## Problem Statement :
The COVID-19 crisis and social distancing had a significant impact on our lives. And it has affected the lives of billions of people and to a greater extent this year. ‚ÄúThe year of the pandemic‚Äù has shown that apps are at the heart of our lives, and we rely on them more than ever before.

## Proposed Solution :
- Upon analysing all of these problems I decided to build an app which would provide accurate information at the time of crisis. As we all know we are being hit by a new wave of covid in every six months or so. We have decided to develop a covid app for covid related details a person would need. 
- Well there are various covid application available out there but the thing that distinguish this from other covid app is it's light weight and beautiful UI. The application is light weight (3.3 MB) which can run on almost all android devices (greater or equal to android v5.0). 
- It shows different Symptoms and information about those symptoms.
- It shows different precautions and information about those precautions.

## Features :

- **Live Data** - COVID infected, recovered and deaths.
- **Symptoms** - Information about covid symptoms.
- **Precautions** - Information about covid precautions.
- **Splash Screen** - Beautiful introduction screen.
- **More Info** - Information about COIVD-19.
